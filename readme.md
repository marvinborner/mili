> Minimal linear lambda calculus with linear types, de Bruijn indices
> and unbounded iteration

Linear lambda calculus is a restricted version of the lambda calculus in
which every variable occurs exactly once. This typically implies ptime
normalization and therefore Turing incompleteness.

We extend the linear lambda calculus with unbounded iteration such that
it barely becomes Turing complete, while still benefitting from the
advantages of syntactic linearity.

## core

Mili's core syntactic representation consists of only five constructs:

``` haskell
data Term = Abs Int Term                 -- | Abstraction at level
          | App Term Term                -- | Application
          | Lvl Int                      -- | de Bruijn level
          | Num Nat                      -- | Peano numeral
          | Rec Term Term Term Term Term -- | Unbounded iteration
```

Lets and Pairs are only used in the higher-level syntax. There are no
erasers or duplicators. This allows us to use a minimal abstract
reduction machine as well as a linear type system.

In general, a more elegant encoding would be *tagless*, as can be seen
in an implementation by [by Oleg
Kiselyov](https://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/course/LinearLC.hs).
However, tagless encodings are hard to work with and can't be compiled.

## roadmap

-   [x] basic syntax
-   [x] linearity check
-   [x] basic reduction
-   [ ] type checking
-   [ ] syntax that embeds linearity (levels?)
-   [ ] compile to LLVM stack machine + reduction shortcut
-   [ ] preprocessor
    -   [ ] `:test`
    -   [ ] `:import`
-   [ ] more examples
